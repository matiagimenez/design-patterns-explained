# Builder

The **builder** pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations of the object.

It provides an elegant solution to the problem of creating complex objects with multiple components.

## Introduction

Imagine you have a class that includes in its behaviour the creation of a complex object, with various configurations.

#### How this class can be _simplified_?

The **builder** pattern solves this problem by abstracting the construction process into separate classes, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. In other words, applying the pattern means following the _separation of concerns_ principle, separating the construction process from the products internal structure.

Without the **builder** pattern, you might end up with a constructor that takes numerous parameters, leading to confusing and complex code.

Implementating the **builder** pattern, keeps encapsulated the code for construction, allowing you to vary a product's internal representation.

The main drawback of the **builder** pattern is that requires creating a concrete builder for each unique configuration of the "product".

## How to recognize a builder pattern implementation?

The **builder** pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a _single creation method_ and _several methods to configure_ the resulting object. **Builder class methods often support chaining**.

The **builder** and factory patterns are very similar in the fact they both instantiate new objects at runtime. The difference is when the process of creating the object is more complex, so rather that the factory returning a new instance of object, it calls the builders director constructor method that goes through a more complex construction process involving several steps. In the end, both return an object instance.

### Real world analogy

Consider a restaurant. The creation of "today's meal" is a factory pattern, because you tell the kitchen "get me today's meal" and the kitchen (factory) decides what object to generate, based on hidden criteria.

The **builder** appears if you order a custom pizza. In this case, the waiter tells the chef (builder) "I need a pizza; add cheese, onions and bacon to it!" Thus, the builder exposes the attributes the generated object should have, but hides how to set them.

## How to know if you can apply the pattern in your project?

A **builder** is useful when constructing an object requires multiple steps, especially when many parameters are involved, some of which may be optional.

In such cases, using a class constructor can become confusing, as handling numerous optional arguments makes it harder to validate the object's state. This increases the risk of creating an instance with an invalid combination of parameters.

The builder pattern addresses this by allowing parameters to be set step by step before returning a fully constructed object. While this approach requires a _concrete builder_ implementation for each parameter combination, it ensures a consistent and valid object representation.

Another advantage of builders is handling complex object initialization, where method calls must follow a specific sequence and intermediate objects need to be generated. Attempting to manage this within a constructor can be a real pain, and relying on a separate initialization method that one must remember to call is error-prone. Delegating construction to a **builder** simplifies this process by ensuring the object transitions through the necessary states in a controlled manner.

## Key components

The **builder** pattern typically involves the following components.

-   **Product**. This is the complex object that you want to create. It contains various parts or components, so several representations of this object exists.

-   **Builder**. An abstract interface that defines the methods for building each part of the product.

-   **Concrete builders**. Concrete classes that implement the builder interface. Each concrete builder is responsible for constructing a specific representation of the product.

-   **Director**. Coordinates the construction process using the builder interface. It knows the specific order and combination of steps required to build the product. The Director is only responsible for executing the building steps in a particular sequence. The Director works with any builder instance that the client code passes to it.

#### Strictly speaking, the director class is optional, since the client can control builders directly.

## Benefits and Trade-offs

-   ‚úÖ More control over the construction process compared to other creational patterns.
-   ‚úÖ Supports constructing objects step-by-step.
-   ‚úÖ Can construct objects that require a complex assembly of sub-objects.
-   ‚úÖ Single Responsibility Principle. You can isolate complex construction code from the business logic of the product.
-   ‚ùå The overall complexity of the code can increase since the pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
